Churn Prediction using Random Forest Classifier
Churn Prediction

This repository presents an implementation of churn prediction using a Random Forest Classifier. Churn prediction is a vital task for businesses, especially in subscription-based services, where the goal is to predict and reduce customer churn (the rate at which customers stop using a product or service). In this project, we employ the Random Forest Classifier to predict customer churn based on various features.

Introduction
Churn prediction is a critical application in various industries, including telecommunications, software as a service (SaaS), and e-commerce. By accurately predicting churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about customers, including various features such as customer tenure, usage patterns, and customer support interactions. The dataset is stored in a CSV file named churn_dataset.csv.

Data Preprocessing
Before training the model, perform data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Training the Model
The Random Forest Classifier model is trained using the preprocessed dataset. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy.

Evaluating the Model
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
